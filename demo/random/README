This demo retrieves true random numbers from a CORBA server on the internet,
so running the client requires a live internet connection.

  See http://www.random.org/
  and http://www.random.org/corba.html

The file "Random.ior" contains the current IOR of the server, which is a
copy of http://www.random.org/Random.ior. The file "Random.idl" contains
the server's IDL description, a copy of http://www.random.org/Random.idl.
"Random.tcl" is just the result of running `idl2tcl Random.idl'.

Run `./random'.

If the client fails to connect to the server, please check the above URLs
to see if the IOR has changed.
